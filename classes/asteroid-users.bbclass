CERES_UID = "1000"
CERES_GID = "1000"

# When adding non-system groups, fixate their group ID to avoid potential
# collisions when the ceres group is created, because otherwise, without
# an explicitly set group ID, the system might just pick ID 1000. But that
# ID is intended to be used for the ceres group.
# Another way would be to just create the ceres group first. However, it is
# cleaner to nail down the non-system group IDs, making their creation and
# ID assignment deterministic.
# (For the system groups, this is not done, since none of the system groups
# require a specific ID, unlike the ceres user group.)
